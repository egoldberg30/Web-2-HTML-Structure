    <h2>Rhode Island’s favorite homemade ice cream shop.
    Every spoonful worth savoring :)</h2>
    
    <p>In 1905, Rodger Melman built his very own ice cream stand right outside the May Beach boardwalk. It was a modest job, but he enjoyed every minute of it. To the regulars, Rodger was known for his ear-to-ear smile. What started as a hobby turned into a day job, and when the Melman family grew, so did the shop. Four generations later, Melman’s Homemade is still serving up joy to the community, one scoop at a time.</p>
